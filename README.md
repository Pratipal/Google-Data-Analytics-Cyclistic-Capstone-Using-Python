# Introduction:

Welcome to my bike-share analysis case study! I am Pratipalsinh Jadeja, and I completed this project on 11th January 2023. In this case study, I will be using Python to perform many real-world tasks of a data analyst. I will be working for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and will be meeting different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, I will be following the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. By the end of this lesson, I will have a portfolio-ready case study that demonstrates my knowledge and skills to potential employers.

# Scenario:
As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, I am part of the marketing analytics team. Our goal is to understand the differences in usage between casual riders and annual members, and use this information to design a new marketing strategy to convert more casual riders into annual members. My manager, the director of marketing, believes that increasing the number of annual members is crucial for the company's future success. To achieve this goal, I will have to collect, analyze and report data that will be used to guide the marketing strategy of Cyclistic. The study was supported by a wide range of data visualization and data manipulation tools such as Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The data will be presented in a compelling way to the Cyclistic executive team, who will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

# Characters and teams:
* Cyclistic: The fictional bike-sharing company with a fleet of 5,824 bicycles and 692 stations across Chicago. The company offers traditional bikes, reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes.
* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and the manager of the data analyst team.
* Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to guide the company's marketing strategy.
* Cyclistic Executive Team: The team responsible for approving the recommended marketing strategy.

# About the Company:
Cyclistic launched its bike-sharing program in 2016 and has since grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles and 692 stations across Chicago. The company offers a variety of pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. The study focuses on understanding the usage patterns of casual riders and annual members and creating a strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

# Data Analysis Process:
The data analysis process used in this study includes the following steps:

* Asking: Identifying the key business questions that need to be answered.
* Preparing: Collecting and cleaning the data necessary to answer the business questions.
* Processing: Transforming the data into a format that can be analyzed.
* Analyzing: Using statistical methods to analyze the data and identify patterns and insights.
* Sharing: Communicating the results and insights to the relevant stakeholders.
* Acting: Using the insights to inform the development of a new marketing strategy.

# Data:
* The data for this project comes from Cyclistic's bike-share program. The data includes information on the number of rides, the duration of rides, and the type of rider (casual or annual member). The data will be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure that it is in a usable format for analysis.
* The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

# Analysis:
The analysis will involve exploring the data to identify patterns and trends in the usage of the bike-share program. This will include identifying differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. The analysis will also involve building data visualizations to communicate the findings.

# Results:
The analysis will show that annual members have a higher number of rides, but the avergae ride duration of casual riders 2x compared to annual members. Additionally casual riders peak during the weekends and they are highly active in the months of June, July and August. This information will be used to create a marketing strategy that focuses on converting casual riders into annual members by highlighting the benefits of annual memberships.

# Conclusion:
This case study demonstrates the importance of understanding customer usage patterns in order to create effective marketing strategies. By analyzing data from a bike-share program, we were able to identify key differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. This information is then used to create a marketing strategy that can focus on converting casual riders into annual members. This project serves as an example of how data analysis can be used to drive business decisions and improve overall success.
